# AlignmentFreeD2
Python implementation of D2 associated statistics evaluting sequence similarities

According to Alignment-Free Sequence Comparison (I):Statistics and Power, D2*, D2S outperforms the original D2 statistic. We implemented D2* and D2S in python.

---
Usage:

Users should first build the sequence occurrence probability model with a list of sequences.

Then users can compute any two sequence's similarity using the probability model
